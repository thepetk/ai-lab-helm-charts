![Version: 0.1.4](https://img.shields.io/badge/Version-0.1.4-informational?style=flat-square) ![Type: application](https://img.shields.io/badge/Type-application-informational?style=flat-square)

This Helm Chart deploys a Large Language Model (LLM)-enabled [chat bot application](https://github.com/redhat-ai-dev/ai-lab-samples/tree/main/chatbot).

## Background

This Helm Chart creates the following components:

### The Model Service
By default the `chatbot-ai-sample` uses the `llama.cpp` inference via the [ai-lab-recipes model server](https://github.com/containers/ai-lab-recipes/tree/main/model_servers/llamacpp_python).

However, the use of `vLLM` to deploy model services, as well as the use of existing model services is also supported:
* For the `vLLM` model service case, the `Values.model.vllmSelected` value should be `true`, the `Values.model.vllmModelServiceContainer` and the `Values.model.modelName` should be configured too.
* For the existing model service case, the `Values.model.existingModelServer` value should be `true` and the `Values.model.modelEndpoint` should be set to the URL of the existing model endpoint we would like to use for this deployment.
* In case the existing model service requires bearer authentication the `Values.model.includeModelEndpointSecret` should be set to `true`, the `Values.model.modelEndpointSecretName` and the `Values.model.modelEndpointSecretKey` should be configured.

### The Application
A [Streamlit](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit) application to interact with the model service which is based on the related [Chatbot Template](https://github.com/redhat-ai-dev/ai-lab-template/tree/main/templates/chatbot/content).

### The GitOps Job
A [job](./templates/application-gitops-job.yaml) which takes care of the creating the application github repository.

### The Tekton Repository
A [repository](./templates/tekton-repository.yaml) which connects our application with the `pipeline-as-code-controller` which allows us to manage all webhooks received from our GitHub Application.

## Prerequisites

- A [Github Application](https://github.com/redhat-ai-dev/ai-rhdh-installer/blob/main/docs/APP-SETUP.md#github-app) with `create repository` permissions for the GitHub Organization where the application will be created.
- Access to an OpenShift 4.x cluster with
    - permissions to deploy an application
	- an existing Namespace where your application will be deployed
	- correctly [installed](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/pipelines) and [configured](https://github.com/redhat-ai-dev/ai-lab-helm-charts/blob/main/docs/PIPELINES_CONFIGURATION.md) OpenShift Pipelines Operator which is connected to your GitHub Applications webhook
	- a Secret (of `key/value` type) in the existing Namespace containing a [Github Token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic) with [these permissions](https://github.com/redhat-ai-dev/ai-rhdh-installer/blob/main/docs/APP-SETUP.md#procedure) to the given Github Organization

## Installation

### Using the OpenShift Developer Catalog

This Helm Chart can be installed from the [Developer Catalog](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.17/applications/creating_applications/odc-creating-applications-using-developer-perspective.html#odc-using-the-developer-catalog-to-add-services-or-components_odc-creating-applications-using-developer-perspective) using the [OpenShift Developer Console](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.17/web_console/web-console-overview.html#about-developer-perspective_web-console-overview).

### Using the Helm Install Command

This Helm Chart can be installed via the command line by running the following command:

```
helm upgrade --install <release-name> --namespace <release-namespace> .
```

**NOTE:**
You can create a `private-values.yaml` file that will be ignored by git to pass values to your Helm Chart.
Just copy the existing `values.yaml` file in this directory to `private-values.yaml` and make any necessary edits, then update your installation command as shown below:

```shell
helm upgrade --install <release-name> --namespace <release-namespace> -f ./private-values.yaml .
```
